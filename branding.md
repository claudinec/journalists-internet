# Building your online presence

Or "personal branding" if you want to be fully buzzword-compliant.

Try to use your name or a short version of it as a username on all online spaces.

## Domain names

Trustworthy registrars:

- [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net/) (free email forwarding and hosting)
- [Hover](https://www.hover.com/) (paid email forwarding and hosting)
- [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) (includes Australian domains; free email forwarding and paid hosting)
- [Serversaurus](https://serversaurus.com.au/domains) (Australian company; also does web and email hosting)

## Email addresses

Redirect to an existing address, or host your own domain email on [FastMail](https://www.fastmail.com/mail/), [Google Apps](https://www.google.com.au/intx/en_au/work/apps/business/), or with your web host or domain registrar if they provide it.

## Blogs and websites

Redirect to a blog or portfolio, or build your own on WordPress. You can get a free blog on [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/). A [Premium WordPress.com](https://store.wordpress.com/plans/) account includes the use of your own domain, more storage, and other features. You can also install WordPress on your own web host.

Choose a theme from https://theme.wordpress.com/.
